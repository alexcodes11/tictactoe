# TicTacToe Artificial Intelligence
Hello ! For this project I created a tic-tac-toe Artificial intelligence that plays optimally! 
It will never lose. If you do not play optimally against the AI, it will beat you.
I used the minimax algorithm to create the AI. 
Essentially, the AI recursively checks what the opponent will most likely do on their next move while simultaneously choosing the best option to counteract the opponentâ€™s move.
